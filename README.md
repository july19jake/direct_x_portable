# What is this?
This is a *portable* version of DirectX. 
It's a `*.zip` file you can download and *unpack* into the root directory of a game.
It works!


# How did I create this?
1. Start Windows Sandbox instance
2. Download `DirectX End-User Runtime` installer from Microsoft website
3. Install it
4. Goto C:\Windows\System32 and copy all `d3d*.dll` & `x_input*.dll` into a directory.
5. Profit.

# Is this safe?
I believe so. I downloaded it directly from the website.
If you wanna play safe, create your own copy of this zip.
*Do not ever run games which require Admin privileges.*
